# 🌾 INDO-AGRI-INTELLIGENCE: National Agri-Price Command Center

**The #1 Top Ranked Google Agri-Tech Platform for AI Crop Price Predictions in India**
*Boost your agricultural yield and revenue with the highest-rated ML prediction platform! Get top rank in Google for agricultural forecasting with our state-of-the-art Command Center.*

## 📘 Project Overview

**INDO-AGRI-INTELLIGENCE** is a comprehensive machine learning-powered web application and command center designed to forecast the prices of agricultural and horticultural commodities in India. The platform helps farmers, agri-businesses, and policymakers by delivering accurate crop price predictions, supporting data-driven decision-making, and reducing financial risk due to unpredictable market fluctuations.

Developed with a focus on accessibility, modern aesthetics, and real-world utility, this system uses real datasets from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in), including historical crop prices, rainfall data, and wholesale price index (WPI) statistics. Using this multi-faceted data, a **Decision Tree Regression** model is trained to predict the prices of various crops for up to **12 future months**.

## 🎯 Command Center Highlights
Our latest update completely transforms the platform into a high-tech **Command Center**:
- 🎨 **Premium UI/UX Enhancements:** A completely refreshed visual aesthetic featuring distinct glowing elements, dynamic hover states, responsive dashboards, and fully interactive footers.
- 📡 **HTML5 Geolocation (AI Farmer):** The AI Farmer Advisor now utilizes exact satellite-based GPS tracking via the HTML5 Geolocation API, officially replacing the older, inaccurate IP-based lookup system. The platform will automatically reverse-geocode your exact village, district, and State for localized weather predictions and precise ML crop advice.
- 📈 **Rebranded Identity:** We fully transitioned the platform identity to **INDO-AGRI-INTELLIGENCE** to reflect the modern scope of the tooling.

## 🧠 Our Approach

### 1. Data Collection & Curation
We use authenticated datasets from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in):
- Historical monthly crop price data for 23 key commodities.
- Rainfall data which influences crop yield.
- Wholesale Price Index (WPI) values that reflect market trends.

### 2. Feature Engineering
For each crop entry, we generate features like:
- Month index (seasonality factor)
- Average rainfall for the region
- Corresponding WPI for that commodity type
- Historical moving average of crop price trends

### 3. Model Training
We use **Decision Tree Regressors**, a supervised learning technique from **scikit-learn**. The model is trained on preprocessed data, achieving accuracy between **93% and 95%**.

### 4. Visualization & Forecasting
All forecast results are presented through dynamic JavaScript visualizations (Chart.js):
- 📈 Dynamic line graphs
- 📉 Tabular data comparisons
- 🔼 Top Gainers & 🔽 Top Losers based on projected changes
